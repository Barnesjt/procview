# procview
This is a small project to view processes, threads, loaded modules, and executable pages of memory. It is an assignment for a class, and the first program I've written in rust.

Here is the assignment prompt:

"Create a program in any programming language of choice that can:

Enumerate all the running processes.
List all the running threads within process boundary.
Enumerate all the loaded modules within the processes.
Is able to show all the executable pages within the processes.
Gives us a capability to read the memory."
